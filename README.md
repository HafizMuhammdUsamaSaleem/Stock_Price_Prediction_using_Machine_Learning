# Stock_Price_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning
A machine learning model to predict stock prices. The model is a logistic regression model that uses volume and open price as feature variables.

## Project Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict stock prices. The model is trained on a dataset of historical stock prices, and it can be used to predict future stock prices with a certain degree of accuracy.

## Data

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains a total of 25,161 rows, each row representing the stock market data for a specific company on a given date. The information collected through web scraping from www.nasdaq.com includes the stock prices and trading volumes for the companies listed, such as Apple, Starbucks, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Qualcomm, Meta, Amazon.com, Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices, and Netflix. The dataset is available on **kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushipitroda/stock-market-historical-data-of-top-10-companies?select=data.csv**

## Methodology:

The following steps were followed to develop and evaluate the predictive model:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and scaling the data.
2. Feature selection: Identified relevant features for the prediction task based on EDA and domain knowledge.
3. Model development: Trained a machine learning model to predict stock prices using the selected features.
M5. odel evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The trained machine learning model achieved promising results in predicting stock prices. The model's insights can potentially be used to make informed investment decisions.

## Futeure Work

In future iterations of this project, consider the following enhancements:

- Explore the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM or GRU to improve the accuracy of the model.
- Develop a backtesting framework to test the model on historical data and identify areas for improvement.
